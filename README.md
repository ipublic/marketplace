Marketplace is a coordinated Unemployment Insurace and Paid Family Leave public Website (portal) that enables District of Columbia Employers and TPA representatives to register their organizations, determine liability/eligibility, file Wage Reports, pay taxes, and perform other necessary functions on a self-service basis.

The IdeaCrew Team produced this initial design based on:

* Requirements specified in DOES Unemployment Insurance Tax System and Paid Family Leave Tax System Requests for Proposals
* IdeaCrew's vision of a built-to-purpose, unified technology solution for Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL)

Developing and operating unified UI & PFL techology offers compelling business benefits and cost savings for DOES and its Employer, Employee, TPA and associated stakeholders.  This project's objective is to demonstrate to DOES the IdeaCrew Team's competency and cability to rapidly implement a superior core mission technology solution.  

The Marketplace application is notable in the following ways:

1. Designed: data models, domain logic and interfaces that apply DOES-specified business rules
1. Instrumented: uses IdeaCrew's development workbench framework for high productivity development, deployment and monitoring
1. Cloud-based: uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud infrastructure 

IdeaCrew presented the Marketplace application component to DOES UITS RFP Selection Committee February 5, 2019.  The user interface is Unemployment Insurance-centric due to that presentation's focus on fulfilling DOES UI needs.  The system design is much richer however, supporting common and independent requirements for both UI and PFL.

The Archimate data model diagram below reflects the Market application component design.

## Technology

The system is developed using Ruby on Rails v5 with MongoDB database.  The User interface uses Bootstrap 4 and a Material Design style presentation that meets ADA Section 508 accessibility statndards.  RSpec is used to perform regression tests.
